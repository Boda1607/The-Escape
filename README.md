# The Escape


A fun and interactive web application that generates mazes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and solves them using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Users can navigate the maze manually, customize themes, and select unique icons for the player, start, and end points. The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Generates unique mazes of user-defined dimensions using the efficient Depth-First Search algorithm.

* **Automated Maze Solver:** Finds the shortest path from start to end using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.

* **Interactive Player Movement:** Control the player character through the maze using arrow keys or on-screen buttons.

* **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Easily backtrack and redo player moves with dedicated controls.

* **Customizable Themes:** Choose from a variety of vibrant gradient themes that dynamically change the maze and UI colors.

* **Customizable Icons:** Select distinct Font Awesome icons for the player, maze start, and maze end points.

* **Responsive Design:** The maze and controls adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

* **Clear Path Option:** Reset your manual path to start fresh at any time.
